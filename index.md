## Ranking system
The auto ranking system is based on the join date of the user. After a set amount of time the user will be promoted to the next rank.
The ranks will be created/maintained by the bot.

The following settings will affect the ranking system
[user_time_ranks](#per-guild-configuration)
[user_time_ranks_prefix](#per-guild-configuration)

*note: In order for this to work the bot needs the manage roles permission on discord.*

The rankings go according to the table below:

Name | Time spend |
--- | --- | 
Spectator | 0 seconds 
Outsider | about an hour 
Lurker | 3 hours 
Prospect | 23 hours 
Friendly | 2 days 
Regular | 6 days 
Honored | 13 days 
Veteran | 29 days 
Revered | 59 days 
Herald | 89 days 
Exalted | 179 days 


## Run the bot yourself

Before we get started I want to note that the development happens mainly on a windows machine, so there might be some unforeseen errors on other operating systems.  
If you do encounter errors, please let me know so I can fix them.  

Right, so lets get started. Before starting make sure you at least have the following installed:

* java 8
* git
* maven
* mysql

Database:  
execute the sql queries in the /sql/create.sql file

clone the project with git  
`git clone https://github.com/MaikWezinkhof/DiscordBot /path/to/project`  
Go to the root of the project and install the dependencies using maven  
`mvn install`  
Now build the project using maven  
`mvn clean process-resources compile assembly:single`  
In the target map there should be a file called Discordbot-VERSION_full.jar (where version is the latest version number)  
Move this file over to a location wherever you want to start the bot from.  

You can launch the bot with the following command:
`java -jar <jarfilename>`  

The first time It will generate an application.cfg file and exit.  
You'll have to edit the config file and add in your token, database configuration, etc.  





## Warning

This project is still in an early stage. Some things might not work or get changed drastically.

## Usage

On the first run it will generate a config file and stop running. You'll need to at least set the token and the property **bot_enabled** to true
